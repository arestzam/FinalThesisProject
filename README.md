# FinalThesisProject 
This final thesis project was submitted on my personal student DBS Moodle account as a prerequisitive for graduation in Software Development (2 years part time). 
The project involved the development of an ASP.NET MVC web application which allows the user to interact with an online E-shop for grocery shopping. The user has the 
option to read product details, choose which items to add/remove into the shopping basket, proceed with payment checkout and finally request delivery of this bundle
order to his home address
